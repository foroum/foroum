<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

<p align="left">
Hi! I’m Maria, a Computer Science undergraduate who enjoys building things, breaking them, and then figuring out how to make them better. I’m especially drawn to problems that mix logic, creativity, and experimentation, and I tend to learn best by actually working on projects rather than just reading about them.
</p>

<p align="left">
Outside of my university coursework, I spend a lot of time exploring new topics on my own through online courses, tutorials, and small side projects. I like staying curious, trying out new tools, and gradually expanding the areas of computer science I feel confident working in.
</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Skills & Experience</h2>

<p align="left">
Through my studies and personal projects, I’ve developed a solid foundation in Java, C/C++, and Python, with experience applying core computer science concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving in practice.
</p>

<p align="left">
My project work has included building small applications and systems, experimenting with game logic and mechanics, and exploring data-driven problems. I’ve worked on tasks such as implementing simple chat-based programs, recreating classic games, and developing programs focused on learning, evaluation, and scoring logic.
</p>

<p align="left">
I’m especially interested in writing clear, structured code and gradually taking on more complex projects that challenge both my technical understanding and design choices.
</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Interests</h2>

<p align="left">
Lately, I’ve been especially interested in areas where theory meets practice, including:
</p>

<ul align="left">
  <li><b>Computer Vision:</b> understanding and working with visual data</li>
  <li><b>Game Development:</b> interactive systems, gameplay logic, and real-time environments</li>
  <li><b>Machine Learning & Data Science:</b> exploring data-driven approaches, basic modeling concepts, and how learning algorithms are applied in practice</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">
I like exploring these fields through small experiments and coursework, with the goal of slowly building deeper understanding rather than rushing through buzzwords.
</p>
