<p align="left">~ The coding bug bit me early at 15, and I haven't looked back since!<br><br>~ My username 'foroum' is just a nickname my friends started calling me back in high school and now it's stuck with everyone!<br><br>~ As a kid, I dreamt of crafting a sprawling RPG where you navigate a chilling zombie apocalypse. Maybe one day, I'll bring that world to life! ;)<br><br>~ Lyndsey Scott's work has always been a source of inspiration since childhood.<br><br>~ Frappe or iced tea? My coding fuel depends on the day's flavor.<br><br>~ Watch Dogs and Ex Machina in 2014 sparked my fascination with cybersecurity and AI. Now, I code to explore those very concepts!</p>
